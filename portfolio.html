                                This project was developed as part of my CSC 4263 course (Video Game Design). It marked my first
                                experience working with a game engine and was completed within a short two-week development timeline.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project was developed in Unity, utilizing Microsoft Visual Studio as the IDE and C# as the programming language, 
                                with Cinemachine as the only imported asset. It was an individual project designed to introduce students to
                                the Unity game engine, and to allow students to show off their stengths before forming a group.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shrink'n'Grow is a 3D third-person puzzle-platformer that revolves around the main mechanic of shrinking and growing
                                the player character. Inspired by my love for games that masterfully convey a sense of scale, I designed simple puzzles
                                that challenge players to creatively utilize their size-changing abilities to progress. A key focus during development was
                                refining the camera controls to ensure smooth and intuitive player navigation, enhancing overall gameplay experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If I were to return to this project, I would focus on refining the size-changing mechanic to ensure the camera dynamically
                                adjusts while maintaining consistent relativity to the player's size. Additionally, I would dive deeper into level design,
                                creating expansive, larger-than-life environments that enhance the sense of scale. Finally, Iâ€™d consider introducing new
                                mechanics and transitioning the player character from a sphere to a more humanoid design to further enrich gameplay.

                                Echos was developed by a small team of four developers and one artist as part of our CSC 4263 
                                (Video Game Design) course. The project had a three-month timeline to propose, design, and develop the game.

                            <p>
                                Created in Unity, Echos utilized Plastic SCM for version control and collaborative project management.
                                As one of the developers, my primary focus was on player movement, camera controls, and refining prototype
                                mechanics. Drawing from my experience as a playtester, I also contributed to bug testing and fixing issues
                                throughout the development process.

                                Echos is a third-person 3D puzzle game where players control an adventurer on a quest for treasure within a decaying,
                                abandoned castle. The adventurer can possess the bodies of long-deceased heroes from the past, altering the course
                                of a tragic conflict. Each hero brings unique abilities that are vital for solving puzzles, enabling the adventurer
                                to overcome obstacles and advance through the castle in the present.

                                I developed this project to explore and implement some of my favorite game mechanics, with the goal of making them
                                reusable for future projects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project is made in Unity 6.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first feature I developed for this project was creating seamless portals for an FPS game, inspired by Valve's Portal.
                                I used a reference video to learn the basics of portal implementation and made modifications to allow portals to function
                                independently, without needing to be directly linked. This project taught me valuable concepts, including matrix formulas
                                for calculating relative positions, the fundamentals of UV texture mapping, and an introduction to shader programming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For future development, I plan to explore additional game mechanics inspired by some of my favorites, such as wall running,
                                seamless vehicle entry and exit, melee combat, and designing an RPG-style leveling system, among others.

                                aspects so far. The game will feature Lovecraftian horror elements and an overarching sense of mystery. Its core
                                gameplay will revolve around turn-based strategy, with a leveling system based on completing events rather than
                                grinding experience from defeating enemies. Outside of combat, players will engage in 3D exploration, with a strong
                                emphasis on items and quests to drive progression.

                                I worked as a Junior Software Engineer at Pixel Dash Studios for approximately two years, where I
                                gained professional experience as a game developer. I collaborated with a cross-functional, medium-sized
                                team of designers, artists, and engineers and also took on the role of the sole engineer for an in-house
                                project using the Unity engine. My responsibilities included designing and implementing core gameplay
                                features such as AI behavior, UI systems, camera controls, combat mechanics, player movement, shop systems,
                                controller inputs, and local co-op gameplay. Additionally, I identified, reported, and resolved bugs to enhance
                                the game's overall quality and player experience. I also participated in daily scrum meetings to to talk about progress
                                and to give me the oppurtunity to reach out if I encountered any blockers.

                                Working at Electronic Arts provided me with my first experience in the game industry. I gained insight
                                into how the development process is managed for large-scale teams by testing new game versions daily.
                                I also developed skills in understanding and navigating comprehensive documentation to accurately test
                                and verify game features and mechanics.

                                I worked as a Quality Assurance Tester at Electronic Arts during the summers of 2021 and from May 2022 to February 2023,
                                where I gained my first experience in the game industry. At EA, I developed comprehensive manual bug testing and reporting
                                skills, providing detailed reproduction steps and contextual information to streamline issue resolution for designers and
                                developers. Working with a large-scale team of over one hundred testers on a live-service game, I executed systematic
                                testing to ensure stability and quality.I used Jira to log and track bugs, ensuring clear communication between me 
                                and the developers.
